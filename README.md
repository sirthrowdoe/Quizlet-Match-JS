# Quizlet-Match-JS
### (abandoned) I realized that adding to the already 2 seconds that it takes to paste the code into the console, it has to scrape a page for the answers, which at least for my Quizlet-Match-Bot, takes a little while, so it wouldn't work out. The score would literally be easier just to go as fast as possible, on your own. I could do it in a way so that on the regular page you copy code to save the variables to local storage, and then go paste and use those on the match, but I don't know why, but I don't like that solution. I just want a single, copy/paste solution. I might do that in the future, I don't know how I'll feel about it tomorrow. I can't code something I don't have passion/inspiration/motivation for.
Honestly there's already ways to get really high scores on the Match part of Quizlet (I've made a bot), but I realized there's a really way to do this, just by pasting code into console.
