# Quizlet-Match-JS
### (abandoned) I realized that adding to the already 2 seconds that it takes to paste the code into the console, it has to scrape a page for the answers, which at least for my Quizlet-Match-Bot, takes a little while, so it wouldn't work out. The score would literally be easier just to go as fast as possible, on your own.
Honestly there's already ways to get really high scores on the Match part of Quizlet (I've made a bot), but I realized there's a really way to do this, just by pasting code into console.
