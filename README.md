# Quizlet-Match-JS

Status: On Hold. I need to figure out that CORS stuff.

Honestly there's already ways to get really high scores on the Match part of Quizlet (I've made a bot), but I realized there's a really way to do this, just by pasting code into console.

I was going to abandon this project but I realized that once you load the match page, you could paste and execute the code. Before, I for some stupid reason thought you had to paste that after you clicked "start", and you'd have at best a 2 second high score. Later on, I realized that grabbing the answers from another page after you've already started the match would take much longer than doing the match yourself. My new solution is pretty dank.
